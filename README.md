REAL-TIME FACE DETECTION USING OPENCV (JAN 2024- FEB 2024):

Developed a real-time face detection system utilizing OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade
Classifier. This system detects and highlights faces in live video feed from a webcam.
● Gained hands-on experience with OpenCV, particularly in using pre-trained
models for object detection.
● Implemented face detection using Haar Cascade Classifier, capable of identifying
human faces in real-time.
